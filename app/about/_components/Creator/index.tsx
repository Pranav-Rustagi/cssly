                        Hi, I&apos;m Pranav Rustagi — a full-stack developer with a strong interest in frontend creativity and building things that feel simple, thoughtful, and fun. I enjoy experimenting with ideas, exploring what&apos;s possible with minimal tools, and creating projects that reflect curiosity rather than complexity.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Beyond small experiments, I work across full-stack development, improving interfaces, solving practical problems, and constantly learning new techniques. I like keeping things clean, lightweight, and expressive — both in design and in code. If you want to explore more of my work or connect with me, you&apos;ll find all my links below.
